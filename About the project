# Data_Analysis_Costumer_Behavior 

Just to make it easier, I separated this repository into three categories. First is this page, the README.md, where you can understand how to read the data analysis. Second is the Step-by-Step, which is the core of this project—read it if you want 
to understand all the work I have done. Third and last is the "Executive Summary", which is a simpler, faster, and very short guide to everything I did and the results I was able to obtain. I really recommend this one if you just want to see the final results
and skip all the boring (but important) stuff. 

Quick disclaimer, this is a data analysis project I created to showcase my knowledge and demonstrate my abilities. However, this doesn't represent 100% of my work; it's simply a way to do what I enjoy (working with technology and data) and earn something in
return.
